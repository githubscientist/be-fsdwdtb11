### What is ExpressJS?

- ExpressJS is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web applications.
- It is an open-source framework that is used to build web applications in Node.
- It is used over the vanilla Node.js http module because it provides a lot of features that are required in web development like routing, middleware, etc. and it is very easy to use and manage.

### Launch app.listen()

- The `app.listen()` function is used to bind and listen the connections on the specified host and port.

### What is middleware?

- Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
- The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

### Understanding inbuilt middlewares

- Express has a lot of inbuilt middlewares that can be used to perform various tasks like parsing the request body, serving static files, etc.

### Custom middlewares

- Custom middlewares are functions that can be used to perform tasks like logging, authentication, etc. in the request-response cycle.
